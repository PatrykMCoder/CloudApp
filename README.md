# CloudApp

## Overview project

Cloud App is app for magazine files on cloud. 

Technologies which I use here:
* Kotlin
* Firebase
* MVVM pattern

## Setup project

If you decide for fork this project you should setup project Firebase: `https://console.firebase.google.com/`. Create project, configure and download `google-service.json`. Copy this file at CloudApp/app catalog. Build project. Back to Firebase Console and enable email auth. Install app on your device/emulator and test that everything works correctly. 

## Application

For now, user can upload file, see details files and download files to device.
